## 🏗️ What's Next: Phase 2

When you're ready, we'll build the **Authentication System**:

### Phase 2 Features
1. Beautiful login/signup pages
2. Google & Apple OAuth integration
3. Email & phone authentication
4. User profile management
5. Protected routes
6. Session handling
7. Auth middleware

**Estimated Build Time**: 1-2 hours
**After Setup Time**: Ready to code immediately

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Development Tips
1. **Keep docs open**: Reference DATABASE_SCHEMA.md often
2. **Use TypeScript**: Types catch errors before runtime
3. **Test as you go**: Run `npm run dev` frequently
4. **Commit often**: Save progress with Git
5. **Read errors**: They're usually very helpful

### Supabase Tips
1. **Use SQL Editor**: Test queries before implementing
2. **Check logs**: Great for debugging issues
3. **Enable RLS early**: Security from the start
4. **Use real-time**: Amazing for live updates
5. **Test auth flows**: Verify each provider works

### AI Tips
1. **Be specific**: Better prompts = better results
2. **Test edge cases**: Try weird inputs
3. **Handle errors**: AI can fail gracefully
4. **Cache responses**: Save API calls
5. **User feedback**: Let users edit AI output
